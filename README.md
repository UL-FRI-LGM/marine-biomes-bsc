# Marine biomes based on Whittaker biomes

A repository containing code developed as part of the Bachelor thesis at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science by [Klara Šuštar](https://github.com/drKhaki).

## Abstract
The thesis shows the process of generating and simulating marine biomes with a selection of specific species of corals. It describes methods of generating these biomes using the so-called drunken walk and determining the properties of each biome. These biomes are then mapped onto the selected terrain, where they will then be used in the simulation. The main approach to the simulation will involve using the factors of each biome and weighing each one correctly. In addition to painting 3D models of each biome, we will visually enrich the project with various effects that imitate the appearance of the underwater world (fog, light reflections, rays and cool shades). The goal of the process is to prepare a more realistic simulation and to enable its modification via the user interface. In addition, the user interface will contain an overview of the entire terrain (biome map), the ability to move the camera, the ability to regenerate the landscape, the ability to stop/resume the simulation and similar modifications.
